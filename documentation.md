# Task #1: Package Optimization Documentation

## Overview
Package optimization work performed on WPMU DEV Plugin Test to reduce plugin zip file size from 6MB to 2.5MB (58% reduction) while maintaining all functionality.

## Problem
Plugin zip file was 6MB due to:
- Unnecessary Google API services (500+ services)
- Development dependencies in production build
- Source maps and unminified assets
- Development files included in package

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Google API Services Pruning
**File:** `Gruntfile.js`
- Removed all Google API services except Drive, DriveActivity, DriveLabels
- Kept only essential Drive functionality

### 2. Composer Dependencies Cleanup
**File:** `Gruntfile.js`
- Removed development dependencies: `dealerdirect`, `phpcompatibility`, `wp-coding-standards`, `squizlabs`
- Removed documentation files from vendor packages
- Removed test directories from all packages

### 3. Asset Optimization
**File:** `Gruntfile.js`
- Removed source map files (.map)
- Removed unminified CSS/JS files
- Removed development files: `src/`, `tests/`, `.babelrc`, `phpcs.ruleset.xml`, `phpunit.xml.dist`, `webpack.config.js`, `Gruntfile.js`, `package.json`

### 4. Webpack CSS Optimization
**File:** `webpack.config.js`
- Removed `style-loader` to prevent duplicate CSS generation
- Kept only `MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader` for production CSS
- Added externals configuration for WordPress dependencies

## Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Package Size | 6MB | 2.5MB | 58% reduction |
| CSS Files | 2 (unminified + minified) | 1 (minified only) | 50% reduction |
| Google Services | 500+ services | 3 services | 99% reduction |
| Webpack Warnings | Multiple asset size warnings | None | 100% resolved |

## Files Modified
- `webpack.config.js` - CSS processing optimization
- `Gruntfile.js` - Added 4 optimization tasks

## Final Result
Successfully reduced plugin size by 3.5MB (58%) while maintaining all Google Drive functionality. Package is now optimized and production-ready.
